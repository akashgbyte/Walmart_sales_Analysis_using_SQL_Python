# Walmart_sales_Analysis_using_SQL_Python
End-to-end SQL project analyzing Walmart sales data using PostgreSQL. Includes data cleaning with Python(pandas), business insights, and advanced SQL queries to solve real-world retail problems
# Walmart Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project

## Project Overview


This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. 
We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation and SQL querying,\

## Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
   - **Tools Used**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (PostgreSQL)
   - **Goal**: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.



### 2. Download Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Used the Kaggle to download the Walmart sales datasets.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)

### 3. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
   - **Libraries**: Installd necessary Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy psycopg2
     ```
   - **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

### 4. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Used functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

### 5. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 6. Feature Engineering
   - **Create New Columns**: Calculated the `Total_price` for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as a new column.
   - **Enhance Dataset**: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

### 7. Load Data into PostgreSQL
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to PostgreSQL using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into each database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in PostgreSQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

### 8. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
     - Revenue trends across branches and categories.
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
     - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
     - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
   
### 9. Project Publishing and Documentation
   - **Documentation**: Maintain well-structured documentation of the entire process in Markdown or a Jupyter Notebook.
   - **Project Publishing**: Published the completed project on GitHub:
     - The `README.md` file (this document).
     - Jupyter Notebooks.
     - SQL query scripts.
     - Data files or steps to access them.
